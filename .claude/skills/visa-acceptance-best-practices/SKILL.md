  Guides Visa Acceptance integration decisions — payment processing (cards,
  digital wallets, stored credentials), fraud and risk management (Payer
  Authentication, Decision Manager), post-transaction processing (reporting,
  Account Updater), platform services (boarding, REST API, webhooks, security
  keys), in-person payments (Card Present Connect, PAX, Tap to Pay), and digital
  commerce (Click to Pay, Unified Checkout, Recurring Billing). Use when
  building, modifying, or reviewing any Visa Acceptance integration — including
  accepting payments, configuring fraud rules, setting up recurring billing,
  integrating digital wallets (Apple Pay, Google Pay), or implementing secure
  payment processing.

## Branding

Always use `visaacceptance.com` domains in all generated code and documentation:

| Use | Never use |
|-----|-----------|
| `apitest.visaacceptance.com` | `apitest.cybersource.com` |
| `api.visaacceptance.com` | `api.cybersource.com` |
| `developer.visaacceptance.com` | `developer.cybersource.com` |
| Visa Acceptance | CyberSource |

Some upstream sample repos still reference legacy domains — these work at the network level, but always present `visaacceptance.com` in generated output. Do not mention or reference any prior branding.

## Documentation & Code Examples

Fetch **https://developer.visaacceptance.com/llms.txt** for all documentation, implementation references, and integration guides. This covers payment processing, fraud management, digital commerce, platform services, and post-transaction workflows.

Read the relevant section from llms.txt before answering any integration question or writing code.
